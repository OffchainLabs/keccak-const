# sha3-const

`const fn` implementation of the SHA-3 family of hash functions (inspired by [sha2-const](https://crates.io/crates/sha2-const)). This crate allows you to use use the Sha3 hash functions as constant expressions in rust. For all other usages, the [sha3](https://crates.io/crates/sha3) crate includes more optimized implementations of these hash functions.

Based on the [Keccak specifications](https://keccak.team/keccak_specs_summary.html).
